RRPAM-WDS Tutorial
===================

RRPAM-WDS or Risk-based renewal planning for asset management of water distribution systems, is a educational software tool that demonstrates one of the many approaches for renewal planning in the domain of infrastructure asset management. It uses water distribution networks as basis for demonstrating the renewal planning approach. However, the principles demonstrated here are applicable for any other infrastructure asset system (e.g. roads, electrical grids, drainage/sewerage networks) equally well.
